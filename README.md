# Botola-Analytics

  Botola represents morocco's first soccer league division. This project represents a data exploration initiative that I lead for a data third party. 

  Data aggragation was an easy task through the famous soccer data provider : wyscoot.

  The objective is to apprehend Wydad Athletic Club (WAC) incredible performance and its causes throughout the 2020/2021 season. We thus compared WAC's features like :`Ratio_Won/Duels`
`Ratio_from_outside_penalty_area/on_target`
`Ratio_Positional_attacks_with shots`
`Ratio_Counterattacks/with shots`
   ... against those of a fictive team where the latter represents the mean of left teams in the league. Our decision variable is no other expected goals (xG) which is the sum of the probability of scoring from each scoring attempt.
